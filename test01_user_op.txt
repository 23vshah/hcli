import datetime

class TextUtils
    method word_count(self, text) 
        instead of just splitting, normalize to lowercase and ignore punctuation
        loop through characters, build words manually, then count them

    method is_anagram(self, s1, s2)
        helper normalize() that strips spaces, lowercases, and sorts
        return True if normalize(s1) equals normalize(s2)

    method word_frequency(self, text)
        return a dictionary of word → count
        use a for loop to build counts

class MathUtils
    method factorial(self, n)
        if n < 0 raise ValueError
        iterative factorial with a for loop

    method fibonacci(self, n)
        iterative fibonacci with while loop
        build a list and return it

class DateUtils
    method today(self)
        return today’s date in YYYY-MM-DD format

    method days_between(self, d1, d2)
        return absolute number of days between two dates

when run as main:
    replace simple prints with a text menu:
        1 → word frequency
        2 → anagram check
        3 → factorial
        4 → fibonacci
        5 → days between two dates
    ask user for input, branch accordingly
    print results
