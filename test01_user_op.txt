            docstring: iterative factorial with input validation
            if n is negative, raise ValueError
            otherwise, loop from 2 to n and multiply into result
        method fibonacci(self, n: int) -> int
            docstring: compute nth fibonacci number iteratively
            if n <= 1 return n
            otherwise build fibonacci using loop
    when run as main:
        instead of always factorial(5), ask the user to enter a number
        print both factorial and fibonacci of that number
